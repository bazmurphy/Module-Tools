# Individual shell tools exercises

This folder contains exercises to help you get to know individual shell tools.

Each folder is named after one tool, and contains exercises to practice using it.

Each folder contains a number of scripts named `script-??.sh` as well as some files that are used by the scripts. You should look in the scripts one at a time and understand what you need to fix.

When a script is complete, move on to the next script.

When a folder is complete, move on to the next folder.

Before running a script you should `cd` into the directory it's in.
You should write all of your scripts assuming they're running inside the directory they're saved in.

Some folders contain a README.md explaining more information, others do not.

We recommend approaching the tools in this order:
1. `ls`
2. `cat`
3. `wc`
4. `sed`
5. `grep`
6. `awk`
